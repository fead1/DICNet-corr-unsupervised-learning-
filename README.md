# UHRNetï¼šDigital image-correlation for 2D displacement measurement Based on Unsupervised Neural Network
 project implementation (pytorch)
## Introduction
In this paper,We propose the establishment of an unsupervised framework for training the Digital image-correlation Neural Network for two-dimensional displacement measurement. To our knowledge, this is the first time that unsupervised learning has been applied to Digital Image-Correlation for displacement measurement.The predicted and original reference speckle images are compared to achieve unsupervised training. Our proposed method eliminates the need for extensive training dataannotation.The large displacement and small displacement datasets were selected to test the model and the model demonstrate its validity and robustness.
